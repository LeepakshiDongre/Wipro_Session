//WHAT ARE WINDOW Functions
Window Functions perform calculations across a set of rows (a window) without collapsing rows like GROUP BY

//1.OVER() Clause Basics

SELECT 
   Name,
   Department,
   Salary,
   AVG(Salary) OVER() AS AvgSalary   //--calculates average over all rows
FROM Employees;

//2. Partition BY (Group-Wise Analysis)

SELECT 
   Name,
   Department,
   Salary,
   AVG(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Department) AS DeptAvgSalary
FROM Employees;


//3.Ranking Functions
//ROW_NUMBER()

SELECT
    Name,
	Department,
	Salary,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNum
FROM Employees;

//Rank()

SELECT 
    Name,
    Salary,
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RankBySalary
FROM Employees;
